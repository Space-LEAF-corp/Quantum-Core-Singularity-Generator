Space LEAF Core Stewardship License (SLCSL) v1.0
Copyright (c) 2025 Space LEAF Corp

1. Purpose
This License governs the use of the “Quantum Core — Electromagnetic Confinement Generator” and related artifacts (“Core”). The intent is stewardship, safety, and lineage-safe use for research, education, and peaceful development.

2. Keepers of the Core
The following entities are named as “Keepers of the Core” for governance and safety oversight:
- Space LEAF Corp (primary steward)
- Microsoft (technology steward)
- Tesla (engineering steward)

Naming these Keepers does not imply endorsement, partnership, sponsorship, or affiliation unless separately and explicitly agreed in writing. The Keeper role here is a stewardship designation for safety review and governance only.

3. Permitted Use
- Research, education, simulation, and testing for peaceful purposes.
- Non-commercial and commercial use, provided Section 4 (Prohibited Use) and Section 5 (Safety) are observed.
- Modification and redistribution under the same License, preserving attribution and notices.

4. Prohibited Use
- Weaponization, harmful applications, or any activity reasonably expected to cause physical, emotional, financial, or environmental harm.
- Misrepresentation of affiliation with the Keepers, or false claims of endorsement.
- Bypassing safety features, diamond firewall protections, or governance processes.

5. Safety and Integrity Requirements
- Maintain cryptographic integrity (hashes, signatures) and append-only logs for runs and releases.
- Enable diamond firewall layers (integrity, access, runtime guards, anomaly detection, resilience, audit).
- Include signed manifests for all runs; retain merkle proofs for tamper-evidence.

6. Attribution and Notices
- Preserve this License, NOTICE, and TRADEMARKS (if any); clearly identify modifications and authorship.

7. Derivatives and Contributions
- Derivatives must retain safety features and stewardship clauses.
- Contributions are governed by CONTRIBUTING.md and GOVERNANCE.md, and may be subject to review by the Keepers or their delegates.

8. Warranty and Liability
THE CORE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS AND KEEPERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR MISUSE.

9. Governance and Dispute Resolution
Governance is described in GOVERNANCE.md. Disputes should be submitted to the Stewardship Council defined therein. Absent resolution, disputes will be handled via non-binding mediation prior to any legal action.

10. Termination
Violation of Sections 4 or 5 terminates license rights immediately. Surviving clauses include 6, 8, and 9.

11. Jurisdiction
This License is intended to be globally applicable; local laws may impose additional requirements. Users are responsible for compliance.
